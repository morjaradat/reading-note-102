# How computers works 
- I learn the computer  is in every where in you phone on camera on tablet on car 
- Things Makes a Computer, a Computer  :
1. input
2. storge
3. procssing 
4. output

 ### How Computer works 
- First step is  the input is the human told to computer by tyoing or recording  then its all store in the storge  then computer processer takes information from memory (storge)  and manipulates ti or changes it using an algorithm ( series of commands)  then send the  information back to the memory to stored again  this continues until the processed information is ready to be output  

### Binary & data 
- The computer works on ones and zero 
 - The information  store using electricity  by the signal  then its on the computer understood that as a one 1 and when its off the computer understand it as a zero 0  this on off are called bit ; when we use more bits we can represent more complex information 
 -  The other information like text , image , sound can be present as a number 
  -  The other information like photo , vedios and graphics  are made by very small dots called pixels and can be present with number 

  ### Hardware and Software 
  - hardware is the physical part like chips , wires , speakers 
  - software is the digital part in the computer can could be app , gamers , websites and else 
   - hardware and software contact with each other by many things  like CPU who  do math & logic  and send & receive information to  and from different parts of the computer
   - the cpu recevie simple command that tell it which circuit to use to do a specific job like add  command 

- binary code is the most basic from of software and it contorls all the hardware of a copmuter 
- now days the software we write  are used commands  and the computers process it  from binary ( zero and ones ) to language we can read and  this make it more easy .
