# HTML && CSS
 - When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
see how HTML describes the structure of a web page Learn how tags or elements are added to your document Write your first web page

- It very important to know the different between the versions of HTML
there is more than one version you have to know which version you must used or which one you prefer to use

 -  I learn in the past they were using (div id="") to  Specify  the header and main  (content) and the footer  like:


 - Now we use new layout element that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page  like header  , footer  like :


-   footer  for & copy; 


 - They usually use header for the main contact and information and we use footer to copyright  .

- I learn The nav element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation like : 

 
-  The article element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.

- This could be an individual
article or blog entry, a comment
or forum post, or any other
independent piece of content.

- If a page contains several articles
(or even summaries of several
articles), then each individual
article would live inside its own
p element A five week introduction to traditional
Japanese vegetarian meals, teaching you a
selection of rice and noodle dishes./p>


- An intensive one-day course looking at how to
create the most delicious sauces for use in a
range of Japanese cookery./p> 


- The aside element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an article>
element or not. ------- we use it to side contact   
example :


- Epcot Center
Epcot is a theme park at Walt Disney World Resort featuring exciting attractions, international pavilions, award-winning fireworks and seasonal special events.

 - The section element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading. example:


- we used  hgroup
element is to group together a
set of one or more h1 through
h6 elements so that they are
treated as one single heading. example: 



- figure figcaption
You already met the figure
element in Chapter 5 when we
looked at images. It can be used
to contain any content that is
referenced from the main flow of
an article (not just images).
