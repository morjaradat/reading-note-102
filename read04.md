# Intro 
1. I learn you can use javascript to  select any element ,attribute or a text from HTML page .
2. we use javascript to make the page more interactive by accessin and modifying the contact  like : you can add paragraph of text after the first h1 element  , change the size or position of an img element .
 3. we can react to events by specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurs like : botton is pressed  .
 
4. I learn In order to teach you JavaScript, this book is divided into two sections :
 - CORE CONCEPTS
 - PRACTICAL A PPLICATIONS 
 5. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.
6. Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.

## what script  mean ?
 A script is a series of instructions that a
computer can follow to achieve a goal .
 how to wriite a script 
## To write a script,
 we need to first state your goal and then list the
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it. 
** simply by three steps : **
1. DEFINE THE GOAL.
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT
3. CODE EACH STEP
 
# EXPRESSIONS 
An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions :
1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
- In order for a variable to be useful, it needs to be given a value ** var color = 'beige'; **

2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE 

- You can perform operations on any number of
individual values (see next page) to determine a
single value. For example:
** var area = 3 * 2; **
 
 # OPERATORS
- Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.

## They are many operators  like :
1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
Assign a value to a 
2. ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Perform basic math
3. STRING OPERATORS
Combine two strings
4. COMPARISON OPERATORS
Compare two values and return true or fa1se
5. LOGICAL OPERATORS
Combine expressions and return true or fa1se 

### JavaScript contains the following mathematical operators, which you can use with numbers  like : 
- ADDITION + , - SUBTRACTION  , DIVISION / , MULTIPLICATION * , INCREMENT + + ,  DECREMENT -- and  MODULUS %  
 
 ### STRING OPERATOR 
 There is just one string operator: the+ symbol ; It is used to join the strings on either side of it like :
** var firstName = 'Ivy ' ; **
 ** var lastName = ' Stone' ; **
** var ful l Name = f irstName + l astName; ** 
 
 - we can use  mixing number and  strings together  like : 
 ** var cost l = '7'; 
 var cost2 = '9 ' ; 
var total = costl + cost2 ; ** 

# Function 
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task.
- To create a function  we give it a name and then write the statments needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces . 
- We can call  the function by function name (); 
- some function need specific information to perform its task  like : 
function getare (weight , height)
